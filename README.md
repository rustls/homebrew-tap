## FAQ

```
cargo: error while loading shared libraries: librustls.so.0.14.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

In some cases you may need to manually rebuild your rustls-linked curl binary/library after updating the rustls-ffi package, this can be done with the following command. If you know of a way to have homebrew automatically detect this please let us know. âœ¨

```
brew reinstall rustls/tap/curl
```
